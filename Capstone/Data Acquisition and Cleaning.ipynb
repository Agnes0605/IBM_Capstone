Until April 8th, there arenâ€™t clear data for cases for different sex, age, and city. Therefore, the data I used to analyze is from April 8th to June 18th. However, there are some numbers not available in population of some cities. I searched it using google. Some cases are unknown sex. I have to leave it alone since the percentage of unknown is minor."
